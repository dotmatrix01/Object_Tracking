# Object_Tracking

This is an OpenCV model that track a rectangular section of Video Captured by selecting that section.The tracker use is the MOOSE(Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error)  tracker, there are many trackers like KCF,GOTURN,TLD,etc, MOOSE algorithm is based on the calculation of adaptive correlations in Fourier space. The Filter minimizes the sum of squared errors between the actual correlation output and the predicted correlation output.
